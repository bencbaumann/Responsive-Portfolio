### Notes about Project
I ended up toying around with some .js trying to create an "ajax-like" experience and also mimicked some angular style directives. Because of this there is only 1 html page. I tried not to use .js to effect the actual css properties to stay true to the assignment. This descision came from laziness of not wanting to have to copy/paste the repeating elements on multiple pages and trying to keep the entire project "front end"
